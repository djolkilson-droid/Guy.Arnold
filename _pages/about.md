I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at McGill University.([https://www.ualberta.ca/en/business/index.html](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/graduates/instream-students))  
My research uses Canadian administrative microdata to study **labour market power**,  
**employer concentration**, and the **distributional effects of macroeconomic shocks**,  
with a focus on the Great Recession and public-sector dynamics.. <br/>

I'm interested in **Labour Economics, and Macroeconomics**. 
Most of my [work](https://jamesmacek.github.io/research) studies **housing affordability** and **regulation**. 

You can find my CV [here](../files/CV-JamesMacek_JM.pdf). Thanks for your interest!
